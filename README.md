##### How to create the game SokubanFX<a name="ArticlesSokubanFX" />

This article series described how I create the game [SokubanFX] with [JavaFX] and 
[NetBeans IDE]. Inspired by my [Java] game `Sokuban-Clone` which I wrote 2008 I 
decided to rewrite the game in `April 2016`.

* **&#40;updated&#41;** The article [01 Setup the project] describes the steps how to 
  setup a new project in [GitHub] with my project template and what are the 
  advantages from using this template [Project-Template-afterburnerfx-Naoghuman].
* **&#40;new&#41;** The article [02 Create first prototype] describes the steps and 
  decisions which I make during the implementation from the first `prototype`.
* _&#40;not started&#41;_ The article [03 Stabilization from the prototype] describes the 
  steps how I stabilize the prototype.
* _&#40;not started&#41;_ The article [04 Extend the prototype] describes the steps to 
  extend the prototype.
