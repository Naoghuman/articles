In this article series I want to give an `overview` about my [JavaFX] `plugins`, 
`libraries`, `games` and `applications` and how they based on and work together.

* An introduction and overview about the articles from this series can be found 
  here: [Introduction Overview Naoghuman's JavaFX Projects]
* In the article [Tier-0 Basics] I introduced the projects which builds the basics 
  from my [JavaFX] development.
* __(coming soon)__ In the second part [Tier-1 Core Libraries] I explained the 
  core libraries from me which I used in all my projects depends on the concrete 
  case.
* __(coming soon)__ In the third part [Tier-2 Extended Libraries] from this article 
  series  I list all libraries from me which depends on one or more libraries from 
  the previous section.
* __(coming soon)__ And in the last part [Tier-3 Applications / Games] I introduce

This article series described how I create the game [SokubanFX] with [JavaFX] and 
[NetBeans IDE]. Inspired by my [Java] game `Sokuban-Clone` which I wrote 2008 I 
decided to rewrite the game in `April 2016`.

* The article [01 Setup the project] describes the steps how to setup a new project 
  in [GitHub] with my project template and what are the advantages from using this 
  template [Project-Template-afterburnerfx-Naoghuman].
* The article [02 Create first prototype] describes the steps and decisions which 
  I make during the implementation from the first `prototype`.
* The article [03 Stabilization from the prototype] describes the steps how I 
  stabilize the prototype.



About the autor<a name="Autor" />

Let me introduce myself. My name is `Peter Rogge` and I'm a software developer 
in Wolfsburg, Germany.

Since `2008` I work by [H+D International Group] which is an IT- and engineering 
service provider represented nationally and internationally in over 20 locations 
with the head-quarters in Wolfsburg, Germany.


In my free time I investigate between `2009` an `2012` some time in [NetBeans RCP] 
&#40;Rich Client Platform&#41; development.  
See  
* The `interview` [Help for Multilingual NetBeans Platform Applications] 
  &#40;09.2009&#41; with [Geertjan Wielenga] and me.
* The `book` [NetBeans Platform 6.9 Developer's Guide] &#40;08.2010&#41; which I 
  helped to translate from Germany to English.

Since `2011` I change my focus to [JavaFX] &#40;[JavaFX 2.0] - [JavaFX 8]&#41;. 
Although in `2015` I saw a video from [Adam Bien] where he mention he would love 
to write a [NetBeans RCP] plugin for his library [afterburner.fx] when he had 
more time.  
So I decided to do this:
* See the [GitHub] project [NetBeansIDE-AfterburnerFX-Plugin] &#40;since 09.2015&#41; 
  which is really helpful to speed up the development from [JavaFX] applications 
  in combination with the library [afterburner.fx].
* The `interview` [Afterburner.fx NetBeans Plugin Release] &#40;11.2015&#41; 
  with [Adam Bien] and me.
* Have a look in the `video` [DI, IoC and MVP With Java FX -- afterburner.fx Deep Dive] 
  where [Adam Bien] introduce my plugin &#40;at 48:00&#41;.
