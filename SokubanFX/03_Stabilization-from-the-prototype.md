03 Stabilization from the prototype

In the last articles I show first how to setup the new project with another 
[GitHub] project from me [Project-Template-afterburnerfx-Naoghuman] and what are 
the advantages are from using this template -> [01 Setup the project]. Then I 
describes the steps and decisions which I make during the implementation from 
the first `prototype` -> [02 Create first prototype].

In this article I described how I stablilizate the prototype. Also some new features 
like `user can now handle the application with KeyEvents` or the implementation from 
the library [Ikonli].

 Click on the picture to see the `SokubanFX v0.2.0-PROTOTYPE` in action :smile: in YouTube.

About the autor<a name="Autor" />

Let me introduce myself. My name is `Peter Rogge` and I'm a software developer 
in Wolfsburg, Germany.

Since `2008` I work by [H+D International Group] which is an IT- and engineering 
service provider represented nationally and internationally in over 20 locations 
with the head-quarters in Wolfsburg, Germany.


<br />
In my free time I investigate between `2009` an `2012` some time in [NetBeans RCP] &#40;Rich 
Client Platform&#41; development.  
See  
* The `interview` [Help for Multilingual NetBeans Platform Applications] &#40;09.2009&#41; with 
  [Geertjan Wielenga] and me.
* The `book` [NetBeans Platform 6.9 Developer's Guide] &#40;08.2010&#41; which I helped to 
  translate from Germany to English.

<br />
Since `2011` I change my focus to [JavaFX] -> [JavaFX 2.0] to [JavaFX 8] although in `2015` 
I saw a video from [Adam Bien] where he mention he would love to write a [NetBeans RCP] 
plugin for his library [afterburner.fx] when he had more time.  
So I decided to do this:
* See the [GitHub] project [NetBeansIDE-AfterburnerFX-Plugin] &#40;since 09.2015&#41; which is 
  really helpful to speed up the development in combination with the library [afterburner.fx]
  in [JavaFX] application.
* The `interview` [Afterburner.fx NetBeans Plugin Release] &#40;11.2015&#41; with [Adam Bien] and me.
* Have a look in the `video` [DI, IoC and MVP With Java FX -- afterburner.fx Deep Dive] where 
  [Adam Bien] introduce my plugin &#40;at 48:00&#41;.
