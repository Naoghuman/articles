02 Create first prototype

In the last article [01 Setup the project] I show how to setup the new project 
with another [GitHub] project from me [Project-Template-afterburnerfx-Naoghuman] 
and what the advantages are from using this template.

In this article I describes the steps and decisions which I make during the 
implementation from the first `prototype`. Click on the picture to see the 
`SokubanFX v0.1.0-PROTOTYPE` in action ![emoticon_smile.png][emoticon_smile] in 
YouTube.

You can download the `prototype` here: [SokubanFX-0.1.0-PROTOTYPE_2016-04-30_08-22.zip]

About the autor<a name="Autor" />

Let me introduce myself. My name is `Peter Rogge` and I'm a software developer 
in Wolfsburg, Germany.

Since `2008` I work by [H+D International Group] which is an IT- and engineering 
service provider represented nationally and internationally in over 20 locations 
with the head-quarters in Wolfsburg, Germany.


<br />
In my free time I investigate between `2009` an `2012` some time in [NetBeans RCP] &#40;Rich 
Client Platform&#41; development.  
See  
* The `interview` [Help for Multilingual NetBeans Platform Applications] &#40;09.2009&#41; with 
  [Geertjan Wielenga] and me.
* The `book` [NetBeans Platform 6.9 Developer's Guide] &#40;08.2010&#41; which I helped to 
  translate from Germany to English.

<br />
Since `2011` I change my focus to [JavaFX] -> [JavaFX 2.0], [JavaFX 2.1], [JavaFX 2.2] and 
[JavaFX 8] although in `2015` I saw a video from [Adam Bien] where he mention he would love 
to write a [NetBeans RCP] plugin for his library [afterburner.fx] when he had more time.  
So I decided to do this:
* See the [GitHub] project [NetBeansIDE-AfterburnerFX-Plugin] &#40;since 09.2015&#41; which is 
  really helpful to speed up the development in combination with the library [afterburner.fx]
  in [JavaFX] applications.
* The `interview` [Afterburner.fx NetBeans Plugin Release] &#40;11.2015&#41; with [Adam Bien] and me.
* The `video` [DI, IoC and MVP With Java FX -- afterburner.fx Deep Dive] from [Adam Bien] 
  where he introduce my plugin &#40;at 48:00&#41;.
