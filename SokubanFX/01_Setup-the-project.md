01 Setup the project
===



Intention

In `2008` I wrote a little game `Sokuban Clone` with [Java] and [Swing2D].

* [GitHub] project: https://github.com/Naoghuman/sokuban-clone  
* Download: https://github.com/Naoghuman/sokuban-clone/releases

In `April 2016` I decided to rewrite the game in [JavaFX].
In this first article I will write down the steps how I setup the new project with 
another [GitHub] project from me: `Project-Template-afterburnerfx-Naoghuman`.
