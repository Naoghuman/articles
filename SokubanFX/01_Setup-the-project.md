01 Setup the project
===



Intention
---

In `2008` I wrote a little game `Sokuban Clone` with [Java] and [Swing2D].

* [GitHub] project: https://github.com/Naoghuman/sokuban-clone  
* Download: https://github.com/Naoghuman/sokuban-clone/releases

<br />
In `April 2016` I decided to rewrite the game in [JavaFX].

In this first article I will write down the steps how I setup the new project with 
another [GitHub] project from me `Project-Template-afterburnerfx-Naoghuman` and 
what are the advantages from using this template:

About the autor<a name="Autor" />

Let me introduce myself. My name is `Peter Rogge` and I'm a software developer 
in Wolfsburg, Germany.

Since `2008` I work by [H+D International Group] which is an IT- and engineering 
service provider represented nationally and internationally in over 20 locations 
with the head-quarters in Wolfsburg, Germany.

<br />
In my free time I investigate between `2009` an `2012` some time in [NetBeans RCP] &#40;Rich 
Client Platform&#41; development.  
See  
* The `interview` [Help for Multilingual NetBeans Platform Applications] &#40;09.2009&#41; with 
  [Geertjan Wielenga] and me.
* The `book` [NetBeans Platform 6.9 Developer's Guide] &#40;08.2010&#41; which I helped to 
  translate from Germany to English.

<br />
Since `2011` I change my focus to JavaFX -> [JavaFX 2.0], [JavaFX 2.1], [JavaFX 2.2] and 
[JavaFX 8] although in `2015` I saw a video from [Adam Bien] where he mention he would love 
to write a [NetBeans RCP] plugin for his library [afterburner.fx] when he had more time.  
So I decided to do this:
* See the [GitHub] project [NetBeansIDE-AfterburnerFX-Plugin] &#40;since 09.2015&#41; which is 
  really helpful to speed up the development in combination with the library [afterburner.fx].
* The `interview` [Afterburner.fx NetBeans Plugin Release] &#40;11.2015&#41; with [Adam Bien] and me.
* The `video` [DI, IoC and MVP With Java FX -- afterburner.fx Deep Dive] from [Adam Bien] 
  where he introduce my plugin &#40;at 48:00&#41;.
